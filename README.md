Kruskal-algorithm
=================

Graph G is used as the primary parameter in the functions which represents the graph in threes cases. 
Dict inside Dict structure is used to store data G[u][v] = weight where u and v is the vertex of the edge, weight is the cost of the edge.

Kruskal.py is the file to implement Kruskalâ€™s algorithm. 
Function kruskal(G) takes G graph as input and returns weight of MST. O(mlogn)

UnionFind.py is the file to implement union-find data structure
